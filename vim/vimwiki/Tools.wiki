== Github: how to avoid entering your ssh keys ==

If you already have your SSH keys set up and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
as opposed to

https://github.com/username/reponame.git
To see your repo URL, run:

git remote show origin
You can change the URL with git remote set-url like so:

git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
