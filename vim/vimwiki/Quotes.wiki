"That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3AM. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, and it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was finished and released to the App Store. It got a whopping 30 downloads on the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it.
