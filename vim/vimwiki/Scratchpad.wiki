= Random Thoughts Here =

== Fitness Goals ==
* workout 3 times a week -> keep this simple A/B
* core 2 times a week -> abs + more
* cardio 2 times a week -> basketball or running, this we'll step over time

and that should be a decent start for now.

* alright, i'll start next week

== Life Goals ==

Really want to plan out my next few years so that I can be able to spend the later
half of my twenties traveling and living out of an XV.

=== Some skills I want to aquire before then ===

* [ ] become a better cook
* [ ] become a better skier
* [ ] learn more about outdoor survival
