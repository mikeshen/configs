== Fitness Goals ==
* workout 3 times a week -> keep this simple A/B
* core 2 times a week -> abs + more
* cardio 2 times a week -> basketball or running, this we'll step over time

and that should be a decent start for now.

== Life Goals ==

Really want to plan out my next few years so that I can be able to spend the later
half of my twenties traveling and living out of an XV.

Always have a beginner mindset, always be curious

=== Some skills I want to aquire before then ===

* [ ] become a better cook
* [ ] learn more about outdoor survival
* [ ]

=== Check Palindrome Code===

apparently there is a O(n) solution

bool checkPalindrome(const std::string& s, int b, int e) {
    return b != e && b >= 0 && e < s.length() && s[b] == s[e];
}

unsigned numPalindromes(const std::string& s)
{
    unsigned count = 0;
    for (int radix = 0; radix < s.length(); radix++) {
         // odd case
        int begin = radix - 1;
        int end = radix + 1;
        while (checkPalindrome(s, begin, end)) {
           begin--; end++; count++;
        }
        // even case
        begin = radix;
        end = radix + 1;
        while (checkPalindrome(s, begin, end)) {
           begin--; end++; count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
